# Deprecation notice

I deprecate this package because I believe the traditional "XML-based UI" is no longer suitable for future development.
Instead, I recommend embracing a modern declarative UI framework.
Declarative UIs, popularized by frameworks like Flutter and React, are, in my opinion, vastly superior to traditional XML-UIs.

# AndroidTutorialBubbles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lovoo/android-tutorial-bubbles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Lovoo/android-tutorial-bubbles) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/lovoo/maven/AndroidTutorialBubbles/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/lovoo/maven/AndroidTutorialBubbles/_latestVersion)
A little ui framework that displays a styled tutorial bubble, which positions and scales itself based on a given anchor view.

###Usage

If you have some element within your layout, that should be explained with a small tutorial, this small library may be your way to go! 

__Features:__
* displays a styleable bubble with custom XML layout
* popup bubble scales itself according to its content and relative to the given anchor view and the available screen space
* bubble displays a dynamically drawn funnel that points toward the anchor view
* anchor view or any other view can be highlighted while the background is dimmed
* simple builder-pattern with chaining config calls

The library uses two approaches to display the tutorial bubble. If you supply a parent view within the builder, the parent will be used to draw the tutorial. 
If no parent view is set and you set `android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission in your manifest instead, the system window will be used to draw the bubble. In the later case, you'll need to relay the `onResume()` and `onPause()` events from either an activity or fragment to your tutorial. 

Check out the code example in the demo project.
